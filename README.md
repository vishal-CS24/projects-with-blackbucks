As part of the Technology Entrepreneurship Development Program (TEDP) at Guru Nanak Dev University (GNDU) in Jalandhar, I had the opportunity to contribute to the development of an engaging and user-friendly front-end for an online uniform store. The project aimed to provide a seamless and visually appealing shopping experience for users looking to purchase uniforms conveniently.
The Online Uniform Store project revolved around creating a dynamic and responsive front-end interface that caters to the needs of individuals seeking to buy uniforms for various purposes, such as school, sports teams, or organizations. By leveraging a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and GitHub, I played a pivotal role in bringing this concept to life.As part of the Technology Entrepreneurship Development Program (TEDP) at Guru Nanak Dev University (GNDU) in Jalandhar, I had the opportunity to contribute to the development of an engaging and user-friendly front-end for an online uniform store.
